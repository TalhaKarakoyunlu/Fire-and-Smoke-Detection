# Fire-and-Smoke-Detection
 This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to monitor live webcam feed and detect fire and smoke in real-time. When fire or smoke is detected for a certain threshold of time, an alert is triggered that includes an email notification with a screenshot of the detection and an audible sound.
